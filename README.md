This repository contains  
1. Inaugural project. 

2. Data project. We fetch data from eurostat, containing data on the GDP and the population the EU countries in the years 2012-2022. We analyse how the GDP per capita has changed over the years and how it is different across the EU countries. 

3. Model project. We model the Solow Model with technological progress and the we extend it with Human Capital. We use both analytical and numerical solutions for solving the models and then we simulate how the different parameters affect the models.
