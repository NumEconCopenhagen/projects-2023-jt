# Data analysis project

Our project is titled **PROJECT TITLE** and is about EXPLAIN.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

To run the dataproject an internet connection is required, this is due to the reason thaat the data is accessed directly from eurostat. 

We apply the **following datasets**, both from Eurostat:
Data X = nama_10_gdp 
Data Y = DEMO_PJAN


**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:

``pip install matplotlib-venn``

``pip install eurostat```
