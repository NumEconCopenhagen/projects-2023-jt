# Data analysis project

Our project is titled **GDP and Capita in the EU** and shows how the GDP per capita has changed through the years 2012-2022. 

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb). 
The notebook calls upon functions stored within [Dataproject.py] (Dataproject.py) 

To run the dataproject an internet connection is required, this is due to the data being accessed directly from eurostat. 

We apply the **following datasets**, both from Eurostat:
Data X = nama_10_gdp 
Data Y = DEMO_PJAN

and a dataset from the .xlsx file:
C_Name_ISO3.xlsx 

Throughout the dataproject we will clean and merge the three datasets and then we will visualize the results in three different interactive plots.

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:

``pip install matplotlib-venn``

``pip install eurostat```
