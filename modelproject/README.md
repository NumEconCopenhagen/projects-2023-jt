# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **Solow Model with Human Capital** and through the project we will investigate how different parameters and variabels affect the long time growth in country. 

The project will start by analyzing the general Solow model with technological progress, first algebraicly and then numerically. We will show the transitionsdiagram and thereby the convergence towards steady state. Then we will show the convergence in a simulation, where we also analyse what happens if you change the different parameters of the model.

For our extension of our model, we have chosen to extend our Solow model, so it now includes Human capital. This model will we also solve both algebraicly and numerically. We will show the phasediagram with the Nullclines, and a simulation for convergence to a steady state level.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
