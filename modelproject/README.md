# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **Solow Model with Human Capital** and through the project we will investigate how different parameters and variabels affect the long time growth in country. 

The project will start by analyzing the Solow Model with human capital, first by calculating the steady state values. Then we will show how the human capital and physical capital converges towards the steady state by using a phase diagram. 
Lastly we will se how changing the different parameters might affect the steady states and the time before convergence happens. 

We will the extend our model by adding a tax of capital to the model instead of the savings rate in human capital. The tax is independent from the amount of human capial and will thus change the dynamic in the model.  

Like the base model, we will calculate the steady state, the null clines and show the path towards convergence. 

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
