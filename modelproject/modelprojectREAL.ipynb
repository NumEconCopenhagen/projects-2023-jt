    "As both are factors in the production function both will lead to an increase in Y, meaning that when you then take the saving rate of the other production factor the total amount of savings will automatically increase. We are however seeing decreasing marginal product for both, meaning that the distance between the two factors the less the more of a difference will we see in the cross effects."

    "We have now gone over some of the main tools to analyze both the general Solow model and the model with Human capital. We found that with the parameter values from the book, which have been found through empirical analysis, that there will be a convergence towards a steady state level of capital in the economy in both models.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is however important to realize that this convergence is only for the tilde adjusted per capita values. With technological progress in the economy, the total level of capital and output will converge to a steady growth path.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly we tested what different oarameters and savings rates would mean for the convergence. We saw that higher saving rates lead to higher levels of steady state and the other way around\n",
    "\n",
    "It is however important to realize that, it is not an easy thing to change the savings rate in an economy. The population obviously need to consume a certain level to maintain a certain standard of living.\n",

    "As it is with these types of models, there are a lot of things can we couldve analyzed deeper, for example it would be interesting to calcute the golden rule savings rate for different parameter values and compare that way. We chose to use the parameter values for USA from the book, but international comparison wouldve been interesting. Other than that it could also have been interesting to look at the convergence speed and calculated that, it wouldve given us a more definitive answer to many of our questions."
